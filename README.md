## Anime Ultimate Warrior Generator

### Introduction

The aim of this program is to take several different anime characters, items for various anime universes, and several powerups and generator a message that combines 1 piece of each to create the ultimate anime warrior. The message is to be used for entertainment purposes and the guidelines were provided as part of the Mixed Messages portfolio project in the Full Stack career path on Codecademy.

### Languages Used and Scope of Functionality

Currently this message generator is using Javascript to randomly select 1 character, 1 item, and 1 powerup. Each category is in it's own array and a function generates the random number so that the character, item, and powerup are not intentionally selected from the same anime universe.

### Future Additions to Functionality

Eventually as I progress through the full stack training, I am looking to add a visual component to the program. Would like to be able to add to a webpage to create a stylized message and include pictures of the characters, items, and powerups. As I grow my personal Youtube channel, I would like to include this on my website as something fun for visitors, but also use it as an additional page to place ads and generate ad revenue.
